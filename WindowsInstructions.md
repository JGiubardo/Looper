# Instructions for Windows
 These instructions explain how to use this program on Windows.
 
 
## Download
Dowload the latest build from [releases](https://github.com/JGiubardo/Looper/releases) and save it on your device.
 
## Using the program 
 Double clicking `looper_win_v1.exe` will cause it to run on every mp3 in the folder. From command prompt it can run on 
 individual files by typing:
 ```
 looper_win_v1 track.mp3
``` 
Running from command line will also provide extra information, including a percent rating on how well the song loops.

## Using with Looping Audio Converter

This program is primarily designed as an accessory to [Looping Audio Converter](https://github.com/libertyernie/LoopingAudioConverter/releases).
In order to have Looping Audio Converter use the loop points generated `loop.txt` needs to be in the same folder as Looping
 Audio Converter when it runs.  To do this you can safely store this exe in the same folder and move mp3 files in, or
 move this exe around your music library and copy `loop.txt` into the converter's folder when you need it.
